v2.2.0
------

* New UI
* New Feature - Annunciators, please Wiki for more info : https://gitlab.com/sum1els737/zhsi-releases/wikis/ZHSI#annunciators
* Added windows_run.bat file for Windows users that have issues with double-clicking the jar file
* Some users experience issues with no magenta line for the flightplan, this should hopefully be fixed now.

#5	Added: Radio Magnetic Indicator (RMI) added, although not quite finished, still needs to do the flags



v2.1.0
------
!!! IMPORTANT !!! since v2.1.0, you need to install the zhsi-plugin version 0.1 (https://gitlab.com/sum1els737/zhsi-releases/tree/master/zhsi-plugin)
For more details about the new plugin see : https://gitlab.com/sum1els737/zhsi-releases/wikis/ZHSI#plug-in

The reason for the new plugin is that I have more control, I can also add custom datarefs if needed. Added some debug logging to Log.txt
Plugin version can be checked via dataref : zhsi/plugin/version or the Plugin menu in X-Plane.

#26	Fixed: I had the F/D bars messed up. Hopefully fixed now.
#33	Fixed: ND Vert Path was not showing on ND, should be fixed now.
#34	Added: Direct to Waypoint Intercept Course *EXPERIMENTAL* might have issues, feedback appreciated.

Other issues: on some Linux machines, the UI was not showing, this should be fixed, UI can also me resized if needed.


v2.0.1
------

#8	Added: Lower DU switch logic for Engine display only, still need to do ND
#24	Fixed: Main DU switch logic fixed
#25	Fixed: ENG2 Fail should be displayed correctly
#26	Fixed: Flight Director should be now displayed correctly for Zibo v3.32+
#30	Fixed: When creating fix ring, font is enlarged. Should hopefully be fixed now.
#22	Added: FPV indicator on PFD


v2.0.0
------
*** all issues now on gitlab - https://gitlab.com/sum1els737/zhsi-releases/issues , this will be the official changelog from now on.

New JavaFX UI (please keep the "ZHSI_libs" folder in the same directory as the .jar. It is the library for some UI elements)
Registration key no longer needed, it just created more work for me and some people are still dishonest and use it for commercial purposes without permission, so I don't see the point.

PLEASE have a look at the new Wiki, important information regarding running ZHSI, Nav Data parsing and Terrain Tiles : https://gitlab.com/sum1els737/zhsi-releases/wikis/ZHSI

#1 Added: Slip/Skid indicator
#6 Added: TCAS 3nm range rings added
#10 Added: ENG Fail annunciations
#19 Added: REF Speed and Flaps setting on PFD
#23 Fixed: For some hardware MCPs, the VOR lines did not rotate to selected course. Should be fixed now.

Other additions: Electrical Display and IRS Display (still some bugs with IRS) under Gauges/Instruments

IMPORTANT Changes: Network mapped drive of X-Plane directory is no longer required for those running on a networked PC. Nav Data can be copied over to the ZHSI nav folder (zhsi_nav_data), please see Wiki for more details : https://gitlab.com/sum1els737/zhsi-releases/wikis/ZHSI#nav-data-x-plane-directory

Terrain Tiles: All terrain tiles are loaded into memory, so if required, only load the tiles needed for the regions you fly. Please see the Wiki for more details: https://gitlab.com/sum1els737/zhsi-releases/wikis/ZHSI#terrain-data-egpws-directory

I recommend at least 2G of max Java heap memory, please see Wiki for more info: https://gitlab.com/sum1els737/zhsi-releases/wikis/ZHSI#zhsi
If you would like to find the current max heap size your OS assigns by default, have a look at the following line in ZHSI.log:

[2018-12-28 17:35:31] CONFIG: Max  Memory: 1820M ( org.andreels.zhsi.e / <init> )
